# A Simple Calculator

Implement a calculator which can multiply two integers.

## Requirements

1. When you run the program as follows, it will output the expression and the result.

```bash
$./mul 
Please input two integers
2 3
2 * 3 = 6
```

2. If you input two integers by the command line arguments, it can handle.

```bash
$./mul 2 3
2 * 3 = 6
```

3. If you input some non-integer numbers, the program can tell you that the input is wrong.

```bash
./mul 
Please input two integers
a  2
```

4. If you input some big integers, what will happen? Please describe some possible solutions, and try to implement them.

```bash
./mul 
Please input two integers
1234567890 1234567890
```

5. Some others which can improve the program.
