# Project 2: Matrix multiplication 

Please implement a program to multiply two matrices in two files. There are 6 files in the attachment. `mat-A-32.txt` is for matrix A, the matrix size is 32x32. Other files are similar. 

## Requirements

1. When you run the program as follows, it will output the result into an output file such as `out32.txt`.

```bash
$./matmul mat-A-32.txt mat-B-32.txt out32.txt
```
```bash
$./matmul mat-A-256.txt mat-B-256.txt out256.txt
```
```bash
$./matmul mat-A-2048.txt mat-B-2048.txt out2048.txt
```

2. Please implement the matrix multiplication in `float` and `double` separately, and compare the time consumed and the results. Give detailed analysis on the speed and accuracy.

3. You can try to improve the speed, and introduce the methods in the report.
